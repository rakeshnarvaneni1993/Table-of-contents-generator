# Table-of-contents-generator
A simple Javascript program to generate table of contents for any school paper.

When I was submitting school paper with only less than an hour, I had to write the table of contents for a 15page paper. 
I did not know the built in word feature to generate that. So, I came up with this idea of wrapping all my page contents in a <div> element and giving headers a <h3> tag and generating the table of contants page by just looping through all the headers.

After I told my friend about this, he told me how there is a built in feature in word to do the exact same thing.

BUt, this program allows you to generate the contnets in which ever way possible because it is programmable.
